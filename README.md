                                            **Global Electronics Data Analysis Project**

Project Overview
Global Electronics, a leading retailer of consumer electronics, has provided datasets encompassing customers, products, sales, stores, and currency exchange rates. The objective is to conduct a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover valuable insights that can enhance customer satisfaction, optimize operations, and drive business growth.

Business Use Cases
Analyzing the provided data aims to:

Enhance Marketing Strategies: Tailor campaigns based on customer demographics and purchasing behaviors.
Optimize Inventory Management: Align stock levels with product demand and sales trends.
Improve Sales Forecasting: Predict future sales to inform strategic planning.
Guide Product Development: Identify popular products and areas for innovation.
Inform Store Expansion: Determine high-performing regions for potential expansion.
Refine Pricing Strategies: Understand the impact of currency exchange rates on international sales.
Approach
Data Cleaning and Preparation

Address missing values appropriately.
Convert data types where necessary (e.g., dates, numerical values).
Merge datasets for comprehensive analysis (e.g., linking sales data with product and customer data).
Data Loading

Insert preprocessed data into an SQL database by creating relevant tables for each data source and using SQL INSERT statements to load the data.
Visualization

Connect SQL to Power BI/Tableau, import the data, and create interactive dashboards.
SQL Query Development

Formulate and execute 10 SQL queries to extract key insights addressing important business questions.
Analysis Steps
Customer Analysis
Demographic Distribution: Analyze customers based on gender, age (calculated from birthdate), location (city, state, country, continent).
Purchase Patterns: Identify average order value, purchase frequency, and preferred products.
Segmentation: Group customers based on demographics and purchasing behavior to identify key segments.
Sales Analysis
Overall Performance: Analyze total sales over time, identifying trends and seasonality.
Product Performance: Evaluate top-performing products by quantity sold and revenue generated.
Store Performance: Assess sales performance across different stores.
Currency Impact: Examine how different currencies impact sales figures, considering exchange rates.
Product Analysis
Popularity: Identify the most and least popular products based on sales data.
Profitability: Calculate profit margins by comparing unit cost and unit price.
Category Performance: Analyze sales across different product categories and subcategories.
Store Analysis
Performance Evaluation: Evaluate store performance based on sales, size (square meters), and operational data (open date).
Geographical Analysis: Analyze sales by store location to identify high-performing regions.
Results
The project will deliver a comprehensive EDA report for Global Electronics, featuring:

Clean and integrated datasets.
In-depth insights into customer demographics, purchasing behaviors, product performance, store operations, and the impact of currency exchange rates on sales.
Visually compelling visualizations.
Actionable recommendations to enhance marketing strategies, optimize inventory management, improve sales forecasting, guide product development, and inform store expansion and operational decisions.
These insights will empower Global Electronics to increase customer satisfaction, maximize revenue, and drive overall business growth.
